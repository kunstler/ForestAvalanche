    | **Abstract (286/350 max)** 
    | 1. Species range limits are thought to result from a decline in demographic performance because of unsuitable climate at the edges. However, recent studies reporting contradictory patterns in species demographic performance at their edges cast doubt on our ability to predict climate change impacts on species ranges. To understand these variable demographic responses at the edge, we need to move from a focus on geographic edges to a focus on focus on climatic edges and analyse how these responses vary with the climatic constraints at the edge and the species physiological strategy .
    | 2. Here we parameterised integral projection models with climate and competition effects for 27 tree species using forest inventory data from over 90,000 plots across Europe. Our models estimate size-dependent climatic responses and evaluate their effects on two life trajectory metrics: lifespan, and passage time – the time to grow to a large size. Then, we predicted growth, survival, lifespan, and passage time at the hot and cold edges and compared them to the range centre.
    | 3. We found that while growth and passage time of European tree species are constrained at their cold edge, survival and lifespan are constrained at their hot edge. We found that demographic constraints at the edge were stronger for species occurring in extreme conditions - hot edges of hot-distributed species and cold edges of cold-distributed species. In contrast, we found limited effect of species' traits on their demographic responses at the edge with only an effect of leaf nitrogen.
    | 4. *Synthesis.* Our study shows a more complicated picture than previously thought with demographic responses that differ between hot and cold edges. We need to refine our predictions of climate change impacts in function of species and edge characteristics.

# Introduction 

Increasing concerns have emerged regarding potential major redistributions of plant
species ranges due to climate change [@Zimmermann-2013]. Range shifts are thought to be directly related to changes in population dynamics. At equilibrium, species' range edge should occurs where mean population growth rate ($\lambda$) drop below one  ($\lambda < 1$) due to alterations in one or more vital rates [@Holt-2005a; @Case-2005]. This is a core tenet of a long-standing hypothesis in biogeography, known as the 'abundant-centre hypothesis' [hereafter ACH, @Brown-1984; @Pironon-2017], which proposes that demographic performance decline at the range edge results in a decrease in abundance but also in occupancy and genetic diversity [@Pironon-2017]. Understanding the demographic pathways of population response at the edge is crucial to forecast climate change impact on species ranges. However, existing studies comparing population growth rates or vital rates in the periphery *vs.* centre of species geographic range showed only weak or contradictory support for the ACH [@Pironon-2017]. Transplant experiments have shown a decline of population growth rate or vital rates beyond the geographic edge but not necessarily right at the edge [@Hargreaves-2014; @Lee-Yaw-2016]. Model based analysis of natural population monitoring data found no clear evidence of a decrease in demographic performance at the geographic edge [@Purves-2009; @Csergo-2017]. 

@Pironon-2017 pointed out in a recent review that it is difficult to synthesis existing results because most studies explored performance of geographically peripheral populations without clearly knowledge of the climatic or environmental constrains at the location. Changes in demographic performance is, however, likely to vary depending on the type of biophysical constraints at the edge [@Gaston-2009] and should be analysed in relation to the climatic contraints for the species [the 'central-marginal' hypothesis in @Pironon-2017]. Firstly, demographic constraints could differ between drought- and cold-limited edges because tolerance to different abiotic stress requires different adaptative strategies [@Niinemets-2006] resulting in different vital rates being constraint at these edges [@Gaston-2009; @Hargreaves-2014]. Secondly, it has been proposed that biotic interactions (*e.g.* competition) could be a key constrain of demographic performance at the edge and that this effect would be stronger for edges in productive environments than in unproductive environments [but support for this hypothesis is limited see @Hargreaves-2014; @Cahill-2014; @Louthan-2015]. Finally, the constraints on the demographic performance at a climatic edge are likely to vary with species' physiological strategy [@Anderegg-2019]. These physiological differences can be captured by species' climatic optimum and by functional traits related to species physiological climate response, such as wood [@Chave-2009] or leaf characteristics [@Wright-2017]. 

An additional difficult arises for long lived organisms such as trees because their vital rate response to climate constraints at the edge might vary depending on the size of the individual [@Tredennick-2018]. This size-dependent responses to climate can be crucial for size-structured populations [@DeRoos-2003; @Tredennick-2018] and can affect the population performance at the edge. We thus need to analyse the performance at the edge with size-structured models translating size-dependent climatic responses and the demographic compensation effect they may occur between size or vital rates.

Here, we explore these questions for European tree, which play a crucial role for multiple ecosystem services such as sheltering a significant proportion of biodiversity and carbon stocks and contributing to the livelihoods of local populations [@vanderPlas-2018].  We used forest inventory data documenting survival and growth of more than 1 million adult trees across the continent covering Mediterranean, temperate and boreal biomes. First, we fitted survival and growth models for 27 species to capture size-dependent climate and competition responses of these vital rates. Second, we built size-structured population models using integral projection models (IPM) [@Ellner-2016] to evaluate how size-dependent climatic response at the edge translate into two life trajectory metrics - mean lifespan and passage time (time to grow from small to large size). We then used these models to compare predicted demographic performance at the hot or cold climatic edges with the performance at the climatic centre for each species. Using these metrics we tested the following hypotheses: (1) vital rates and IPM derived performance metrics are reduced at the climatic edge compared to the climatic centre for but the demographic constraints differ between cold and hot edges; (2) the decline in demographic performance at the climatic edges is stronger with local competition than without; and (3) demographic performance at the climatic edges depends on species climatic optimum and functional traits related to species' climatic response (wood density, leaf economic spectrum traits, leaf size, and xylem vulnerability to embolism).


# Materials and Methods

In this section we present the climatic dependent IPM development and the data used to fit growth and survival models. Then we present the data used to develop the species distribution models that we used to select climatic edges corresponding to a species distribution limit. Finally we present how we used the growth and survival models and the climatic and local competition dependent IPM to derive metrics of demographic performance at the climatic edge *vs.* the climatic center of the species distribution and tested our three hypothesis.


## **Forest inventory**

We used the European forest inventory (NFI) data compiled in the FunDivEUROPE project [@Baeten-2013;@Ratcliffe-2015]. The data covers 91,528 plots and more than 1 million trees in Spain, France, Germany, Sweden and Finland. NFIs record information on individual trees in each plot, including species identity, diameter at breast height (dbh), and status (alive, dead, harvested or recruited). Plot design varies between countries but generally plots are circular with variable radii depending on tree size (see Supplementary Materials). The minimum dbh of trees included in the dataset was 10 cm. Plots were remeasured over time allowing estimations of individual growth and survival. Only the French NFI is based on a single measurement but includes measurement of radial growth with cores and estimation of time since death allowing to estimate these vital rates. We selected species with > 2,000 individuals and > 500 plots, to ensure a good coverage of their range, growth, and survival. We excluded exotic species for which the distribution is mainly controlled by plantation operations. For the demographic analyses, we also excluded all plots with records of harvesting operations or disturbances between the two surveys, which would otherwise influence our estimation of local competition.

## **Climate variables**

We used two bioclimatic variables known to control tree demography [@Kunstler-2011]: (1) the sum of degree days above 5.5 $^\circ$C ($sgdd$), and (2) the water availability index ($wai$). $sgdd$ is the cumulative day-by-day sum of the number of degrees > 5.5 $^\circ$C and is related to the mean annual temperature and the length of the growing season. It was extracted from E-OBS, a high resolution (1 km$^2$) downscaled climate data-set [@Moreno-2016] for the years between the two surveys plus two years before the first survey. In preliminary analysis we also explored the number of frost days but it was too correlated to $sgdd$ to be included in the models. $wai$ was computed using precipitation ($P$, extracted from E-OBS) and potential evapotranspiration ($PET$) from the Climatic Research Unit [@Harris-2014] data-set, as $(P- PET)/PET$ and is related to the water availability [as in @Ratcliffe-2017]. We also explored other water stress index but they did not improved the models' fit so we decided to use $wai$.

## **Integral projection models**
An IPM predicts the size distribution, $n(z',t+1)$, of a population at time $t+1$ from its size distribution at $t$, $n(z,t)$ (with $z$ the size at $t$ and $z'$ the size at $t+1$), based on the following equation [@Easterling-2000; @Ellner-2016]:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:IPM1}
n(z',t+1) = \int_L^U K(z',z) n(z,t) dz
\end{equation}

The kernel $K(z',z)$ can be split into the survival and growth kernel ($P(z',z)$) and the fecundity kernel ($F(z',z)$), as follow $K(z',z) = P(z',z) + F(z',z)$. $P(z',z)$ is defined as $P(z',z) = s(z)  G(z',z)$ and represents the probability that an individual of size $z$ survives between $t$ and $t+1$ and reaches the size $z'$. The size of the individuals $z$ can range between $L$ and $U$. NFI data do not provide direct information on tree fecundity, thus our models describe the fate of a cohort (a cohort IPM for individuals with dbh $>=$ 10 cm) by focusing only on $P(z',z)$ (in Supplementary Materials, we provide a sensitivity analysis of tree population growth to fecundity). Even if it do not cover the full life cycle, cohort IPM allows to predict life trajectory metrics accounting for size-dependent climate responses and compensatory effect between vital rates. 

For each of the 27 species, we fitted growth and survival functions depending on tree size, the two climatic variables ($sggd$ and $wai$) and local competition estimated as the sum of basal area of competitors [following @Kunstler-2011]. The shape of the climatic response curves and the type of interaction between climate and size and climate and competition (that represents size-dependent response) can have a large impact on vital rates predictions and IPM derived life trajectory metrics. To account for such uncertainties, we re-sampled 100 times 70$\%$ of the data to fit the model and select the best type of climatic response curves and interactions based on the Akaike information criteria (*i.e.*, lowest AIC) [@Burnham-2002]. Because there were fewer plots in extreme climatic conditions, we re-sampled the data with a higher probability of sampling plots in extreme climatic conditions for the given species (see details in Supplementary Materials). Then we used the remaining 30$\%$ of the data to evaluate the goodness of fit of the growth and survival models. Goodness of fit and response curves of growth and survival models are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Figs \ref{G_D} to \ref{AUC}).

### Growth model

After preliminary exploration, we selected two alternative shapes of the climatic response curves: asymptotic or quadratic polynomial corresponding to the equations \ref{eq:G1} and \ref{eq:G2}. These equations allow flexible shapes (increasing, decreasing, bell or U shaped) and correspond to two alternative biological models: (i) either all species have their optimum at high water availability and sum of degree days; or (ii) species have bell-shaped climate response curves with different optima along the climatic variables:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G1}
\begin{split}
log(G_{i,p}) = &a_0 + a_{0,p} + a_1 \: D_i + a_2 \: log(D_i) + \\
               &a_3 \: BA_{i} + a_4 \: \frac{1}{sgdd_p} + a_5 \: \frac{1}{wai_p} + \varepsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G2}
\begin{split}
log(G_{i,p}) = &a_{0,c} + a_{0,p} + a_1 \: D_i + a_2 \: log(D_i) + a_3 \: BA{i} + \\
               &a_4 \: sgdd_p +  a_5 \: sgdd_p^2 + a_6 \: wai_p + a_7 \: wai_p^2 + \varepsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $G_{i,p}$ is the annual diameter growth of tree $i$ in plot $p$, $D_i$ is the dbh of tree $i$, $BA_{i}$ is the sum of basal area of local competitors of tree $i$ per ha (sum basal area of both conspecific and heterospecific trees in the plot in a single local competition index), $sgdd_p$ is the sum of growing degree days, $wai_p$ is the water aridity index, $a_0$ to $a_7$ are estimated parameters, and $a_{0,p}$ is a normal random plot effect accounting for unexplained variation at the plot level. The intercept $a_{0,c}$ is country specific to account for differences in protocol between NFIs and $\varepsilon_i$ is the unexplained tree level variability following a normal distribution. We also tested models with interactions between the climatic variables - $1/sgdd_p$ and $1/wai_p$ for model \eqref{eq:G1} and $sgdd_p$ and $wai_p$ for model \eqref{eq:G2}) - and size ($D_i$ and $log(D_i)$ and the climatic variables and competition. We fitted the models in R-cran separately for each species [@Rcran] using the 'lmer' function ['lme4' package, @Bates-2015]. 

### Survival model

Survival models were fitted with a generalised linear model with a binomial error. The predictors and interactions explored were the same as in the growth model. To account for variable survey times between plots we used the complementary log-log link with an offset representing the number of years between the two surveys ($y_p$) [@Morris-2013]. We fitted the model in R-cran using the 'glm' function. We did not include a random plot intercept because in most plots no individuals died between the surveys, making the estimation of the random plot effect challenging. 

### Tree harvesting

Although we excluded plots with evidence of harvesting between the two surveys to fit the survival functions, most European forests are subject to management, which has a strong impact on population dynamics [@Schelhaas-2018]. Harvesting of dying or damaged trees is probably resulting in an underestimation of the natural mortality rate. To make sensible predictions with our IPMs it was thus necessary to incorporate a harvesting rate to prevent an overestimate of tree lifespan. We set a mean harvesting rate, estimated across all species and inventories, as 0.5$\%$ per year. We did not model size and climate dependence of the harvesting rate, as we focused on climatic and not anthropogenic constraints on tree demography.

## **Prediction of demographic metrics at the climatic edges and centre of species range**

### Species distribution

To identify the climatic edge of a species range, a simple representation of its distribution is necessary. Across Europe, there is a strong correlation between $sgdd$ and $wai$, and so we described species ranges along a single climatic axis corresponding to the first axis (PC1) of the PCA of $sgdd$ and $wai$ (Supplementary Materials, Fig. \ref{PCA_CLIM}). Species showed a clear segregation along this climatic axis in Europe (Fig. 1). Based on the coordinates on PC1 of the plots where the species was present, we identified the median climate as their median value of PC1 (that we used as an index of climatic optimum), the hot and dry edge (hereafter hot edge) and the cold and wet edge (hereafter cold edge), respectively, as their $5\%$ and $95\%$ quantiles. These quantiles represent two extreme climatic conditions experienced by the species in contrast to the climate experienced at median PC1. In focusing on climatic marginal populations, our approach differs from most test of the ACH reviewed in @Pironon-2017 which focused on populations at the periphery of the species geographic range.

To evaluate which species' edges corresponded to an actual limit in the species distribution and not just to limits in the coverage of the data, we fitted species distribution models with BIOMOD2 [@Thuiller-2009]. To do so we used presence/absence data covering all Europe [@Mauri-2017] (see Supplementary Materials). For comparison of the demographic performance at the edge *vs.* the centre of the distribution, we retained only the edges with a at least $10\%$ drop in the probability of presence of the species predicted by the SDM (Fig. 1).

### Demographic metrics

To evaluate how individual performance varied between the range centre and the edges, we derived four metrics representing key dimensions of population performance. The first two metrics were related to individual vital rates, and were defined by the growth and survival of 15 cm dbh individuals [focusing on small individual because of their strong effect on population dynamics, @Grubb-1977]. The last two metrics were life trajectory metrics integrating the vital rates and size-dependent responses in the IPM, and were defined by the mean lifespan of a 10 cm dbh individual and the passage time of a 10 cm dbh individual to 60 cm. The details of the numerical methods used to compute lifespan and passage time from the IPM are provided in the Supplementary Materials. Model diagnostics showed that our numerical approach was not sensitive to the number of size bins retained for the IPM (*i.e.* # bins > 800 , see Fig. \ref{SENS} in Supplementary Materials).

We predicted the four demographic metrics at the centre and the hot and cold climatic edges of the species using their positions on the climatic axis. The median, and $5\%$ and $95\%$ quantiles on the PC1 correspond to the projection of a unique combination of $sggd$ and $wai$ for which we predicted the two vital rates metrics and the two IPM derived life trajectory metrics. We integrated uncertainty into our estimates by deriving each demographic metrics for all 100 re-sampled growth and survival models (see above). Because competitive interactions may also be important in controlling species demography at the edge of the range [@Louthan-2015], we made these predictions either without local competition (by setting $BA$ to 0) or with a high level of local competition (by setting $BA$ to $30 m^2 ha^{-1}$, corresponding to a closed forest).

### Analysis of the relative demographic performance at the climatic edges

For each demographic metric ($m$) we computed the relative difference in the metric at the edge (hot or cold) *vs.* the centre as: 
$\Omega_{edge}^{m} = (m_{edge} - m_{centre})/m_{centre}$.
We integrated uncertainty by deriving estimates of $\Omega_{edge}^m$ for each of the 100 re-sampled growth and survival models.

Then, for each metric, we tested whether species demographic performance declines at the climatic edge compared to the climate centre (hypothesis 1) by fitting a mixed model to test if $m$ was function of the range position type (edge *vs.* centre) (with the function *lmer* in *lme4*). We included a random species effect to account for the non-independence of the 100 re-sampled estimates per species. We ran this analysis separately for hot and cold edges to see how demographic responses differ between them. Secondly, we tested whether the effects were different without or with competition (hypothesis 2). 

Thirdly, we explored whether $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ was dependent on species median climate and functional traits related to species' climatic response (hypothesis 3). We used  Phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regression using a phylogeny extracted from @Zanne-2014 to account for phylogenetic dependence between species. We accounted for the uncertainty in the demographic response by including a weight proportional to the inverse of the variance of $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ (estimated over the 100 re-sampled growth and survival models). The PGLS regression with maximum likelihood estimation of Pagel's lambda (a measure of the phylogenetic signal ranging between 0 and 1) did not always converged. In those cases we fitted a PGLS model with a Brownian model (Pagel's lambda set at 1). We retained only the regressions that were both significant (after a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons) and had a non-negligible magnitude of the effect [@Camp-2008]. The magnitude of the effect was considered negligible when the confidence interval of the effect size intercepted the interval -0.10 and 0.10 [@Camp-2008]. Effect sizes were computed as the standardised slope [@Schielzeth-2010]. 

Firstly, to test the link between $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ and species median climate, we run the PGLS regression between $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ and the species median position on PC1 taken as the median climatic condition experienced by the species. Secondly, we tested the links between $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ and four functional traits that are known to influence tree response to climate (see below), with the same PGLS regression approach. We selected: (i) wood density, which is related to drought and temperature response [@Chave-2009; @Stahl-2014]; (ii) the leaf economic spectrum (LES) because species at the conservative end of the spectrum are thought to be more tolerant to extreme climate [@Reich-2014]; (iii) leaf size, which is related to plant response to water stress and frost [@Wright-2017]; and (iv) xylem vulnerability to embolism measured by the water potential leading to $50\%$ loss of xylem conductivity, $\Psi_{50}$, a strong predictor of drought-induced mortality [@Anderegg-2016].  LES is based on the covariance of specific leaf area, leaf lifespan, and leaf nitrogen per mass [@Wright-2004]. We used leaf nitrogen per mass ($N_{mass}$), as it was the LES trait with the best coverage across our species. Trait data were sourced from open databases [@Chave-2009; @Wright-2004; @Maire-2015; @Wright-2017; @Choat-2012].

# Results

## **Size-dependent growth and survival climatic responses**

For several species the growth and survival models showed evidence of interactions between climate and size and for smaller subset of species also between climate and competition (see Tables 2 and 3 Supplementary Materials). This indicates that size-dependent climatic responses were frequent. Model selection over the 100 re-sampled data showed that for 26 species out of 27 the most frequently selected growth model included interaction between climate variables and tree size (see Table 2 in Supplementary Materials). Selection of the best survival model was more variable between species and the 100 data re-sampling than for the growth models. For 18 species out of 27 the most frequently selected survival models included interactions between climatic variables and tree size (see Table 3 Supplementary Materials). For both growth and survival several species also showed evidence of or interactions between climate variables and competition (see Tables 2 and 3 Supplementary Materials). 

## **Demographic responses differ between edge types and metrics**

Across the 27 species we found evidence of a significant decrease in growth and increase in passage time (longer time needed to grow from 10 to 60 cm) at the cold edge in comparison with the centre of the distribution but no effect at the hot edge (Fig. 2). In contrast, at the hot edge, we found evidence of a significant decrease in both tree survival and lifespan (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the hypothesis that at least one metric will decline in performance at the edge, and that different metrics are affected depending on the edge type. In contrast, we found that lifespan was significantly longer at the cold edge than at the centre of the distribution (Fig. 2). Generally, these patterns were unaffected by local competition (Fig. 3), however, it is important to note that the relative increase in lifespan at the cold edge in comparison with the centre became non-significant at high levels of competition, which may show that competition constrains performance at the edge for some species.

Behind the overall demographic response at the edge, there were large variations between species. For each metric and edge type we found species showing a decrease and species showing an increase in performance (Supplementary Materials; Figs \ref{growth} to \ref{lifespan}). 

## **Demographic responses vary with species median climate**

Growth response at the hot and cold edges was related to the median climate of the species; species with median climate in hot climates were more constrained at their hot edge while species with median climate in cold climates were more constrained at their cold edge. This result is depicted in Fig. 4 by a positive relationship between the median climate of the species and $\Omega_{hot \, edge}^{growth}$ and a negative relationship with $\Omega_{cold \, edge}^{growth}$ . The same pattern is visible for passage time, but in the opposite direction, because passage time is longer when growth is slower (Fig. 4).  The responses of $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ for survival and lifespan were much weaker or null. We found a negative relationship for $\Omega_{hot \, edge}^{survival}$, which was largely related to a few extreme species, and no effect for lifespan (Fig. 4).

## **Weak links between demographic response and species traits**

$N_{mass}$ had the strongest relationship with $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ of all the traits we tested. At the hot edge, species with high $N_{mass}$ experienced
a stronger decrease in their survival and lifespan than species with a low $N_{mass}$ (Fig. 5). In contrast, at the cold edge, species with low $N_{mass}$ experienced a stronger decrease in their survival and lifespan than species with high $N_{mass}$ (Fig. 5).  In addition, species with high $N_{mass}$ had less limitation of their growth at the hot edge than species with low $N_{mass}$ (Fig. 5).

Relationships between $\Omega_{edge}^{m}$ and wood density, leaf size and xylem vulnerability to embolism were generally weak (Supplementary Materials, Figs \ref{WD} to \ref{leafarea}). Species with small leaf area had better survival, growth, and passage time at the cold edge than large leafed species (Supplementary
Materials, Fig. \ref{leafarea}) and species with high $\Psi_{50}$ experienced
a stronger decrease in their growth at
the hot edge than species with low $\Psi_{50}$ (Supplementary
Materials, Fig. \ref{Psi50}). However, the pattern was driven by a few species (Supplementary
Materials, Fig. \ref{Psi50}).

# Discussion

Our analysis based on pan-European forest inventory data and integral projection models of 27 species, found weak support for the ACH prediction that demographic performance is lower at the climatic edge than at the centre of the species range. Instead, decline in demographic performance was strikingly different between the cold and the hot edges. At cold and wet edges, growth and passage time were constrained, whereas at hot and dry edges, survival and lifespan were constrained. Beyond these general patterns, we found important variability between species in their demographic performance at the edge, which was partially explained by species' median climate and traits. 

## **Different demographic responses at the hot and the cold edge**

We found mixed support for the ACH, not all the demographic metrics were limited at the edges and patterns were variable between species. This is consistent with observational studies that found limited evidence of a relationship between species demography and their distribution. For instance, both @Thuiller-2014 and @Csergo-2017 found limited correlation between plants demographic performance and probability of presence. In addition, @Purves-2009 reported mixed evidence of a decrease in demographic performance at the south and north edges of North American tree species.

Growth and passage time were constrained at the cold edge in comparison with the centre of the species distribution. This is consistent with studies on North American tree species, that found a decrease in growth at the cold edge in adult trees [@Purves-2009] and juveniles [@Ettinger-2017; @Putnam-2017]. In contrast with the ACH, we found a tendency for a slightly faster growth at the hot edge than at the centre, which has also been reported in North American trees [@Purves-2009; @Ettinger-2017; @Putnam-2017].

At the hot and dry edge, tree survival and lifespan were lower than at the centre of the range. In contrast, @Purves-2009 found no such decrease in survival at the hot edge of eastern North American species. This difference could be explained by the fact that the hot edge of most European species corresponds to both a hot and a dry climate, whereas in eastern America the hot edge is less constrained by drought [@Zhu-2014]. We found that lifespan was longer at the cold edge than at the centre of the distribution. This is in contradiction with the classical view that survival is constrained in cold climates and the results of @Purves-2009. Given that tree growth rate is constrained at the cold edge, this longer lifespan could be explained by a tradeoff between tree growth rate and tree longevity [both inter- and intra-specific, see @Black-2008; @DiFilippo-2015] and the observation that survival rate correlates negatively with site productivity [@Stephenson-2011].  

### Lack of competition effect

Numerous studies have proposed that competitive interactions could be crucial in setting demographic limits, particularly at the productive edge [see @Hargreaves-2014; @Louthan-2015; @Alexander-2016; @Ettinger-2017; @Hillerislambers-2013; @Jump-2017]. In our analyses, we explored the effect of competition by comparing the relative demographic performance at the edge in comparison with the centre ($\Omega$) without local competition or with a high level of local competition. Despite the strong direct effects of competition on both growth and survival and interactions between competition and climate, the relative demographic responses at the edges *vs.* the centre (measured by $\Omega$) were not strongly influenced by the degree of local competition. Competition is thus a strong determinant of demographic rates but its effect is not stronger at the climatic edge than at the climatic centre (rejecting the hypothesis 2). The only evidence of competition contraints at the edge that we found was that without competition; lifespan increased at the cold edge only in the absence of competition.

Three main reasons could explain the lack of competitive effect on the demographic response at the edge in our study. Firstly, properly estimating competitive effect with observational data is notoriously difficult [@Tuck-2018]. Secondly, we did not differentiate between intra- and inter-specific competition, whereas inter-specific competition might have the strongest impact at the edge [@Alexander-2016]. Thirdly, as our cohort IPMs do not cover the full life cycle it was not possible to evaluate whether competitive exclusion - the final effect of competition [@Chesson-2018] - occurs at the edge.

### Size-dependent climatic response

We found strong evidence that both growth and survival responses to climatic constraints were size-dependent. Our results agree with previous studies which found that tree growth or survival climatic responses varied with ontogeny [@Canham-2017; @Trouillier-2019]. For instance, @Canham-2017 found a displacement of the climatic optimum of growth and survival between seedlings, saplings, and canopy trees. These size-dependent climatic responses, however, did not strongly influenced the life trajectories metrics derived with IPM as the lifespan response at the edge was closely connected to the survival of a 15 cm dbh tree and the passage time was closely related to the growth of a 15 cm dbh tree. This means that these size-dependent response were either of small magnitudes or led to little compensation effects between size classes. @Tredennick-2018 also found little effect of size-dependent environmental responses on the population growth of perennial plant species. 

## **Strong effect of species median climate on growth response at the edge**

We found that the hotter the centre of the species range the greater was the constraints on growth and passage time at its hot edge. The same pattern was found with the cold edge and the species median climate proximity to cold extreme. This is in agreement with the general pattern of vegetation productivity in Europe, which is at its maximum in temperate climates where both drought and cold stress are limited [@Jung-2007].

## **Weak traits effect on species demographic response at the edge**

Part of the variation in the demographic response at the edge was related to $N_{mass}$, a key dimension of the leaf economic spectrum. An important difficulty in the interpretation of these results is that our understanding of the link between leaf economic traits and climate is limited.  Multiple mechanisms, some of them contradictory, have been proposed to explain the link between leaf N and climate. For instance, it is generally considered that species with low $N_{mass}$ have a more conservative strategy of resource use and perform better in stressful conditions than species with high $N_{mass}$ [@Reich-2014]. In agreement with this finding, we found that species with low $N_{mass}$ had a better survival and lifespan at the hot edge. In contrast, high leaf N has been linked with photosynthesis tolerance to drought and low temperature because of higher enzyme activities [@Wright-2003; @Reich-2004]. Consistent with this mechanism, we found that species with high $N_{mass}$ had a better survival and lifespan at the cold edge and a better growth at the hot edge.

We found limited relationships between leaf size or xylem vulnerability to embolism and demographic response, which was surprising as the mechanisms related to climate response are better understood for these traits. Smaller leaves were related to a longer lifespan at the hot edge and a better survival, growth and passage time at the cold edge. This in agreement with @Wright-2017 who proposed that large leaves are disadvantaged in hot and dry climates because their transpiration rate during the day is too high and are disadvantaged in cold climate because they have greater risks of reaching critical low temperatures during the night. @Anderegg-2019 also reported weak link between traits and drought related mortality at the edge, with only an effect for xylem vulnerability to embolism. The effect was, however, that drought adapted species experienced higher drought mortality at the edge.

### On the challenge of connecting population dynamics and species ranges

Based on our results, it is difficult to conclude if there is a clear decrease in population growth rate at the edges. A key limitation is that our analysis did not include the regeneration phase, which is thought to be a bottleneck in tree population dynamics [@Grubb-1977]. In the Supplementary materials, we provide an evaluation of the importance of this phase for tree population growth rate with an elasticity analysis of matrix population models extracted from the COMPADRE Plant matrix database [@Salguero-Gomez-2015]. The analysis shows that the regeneration and adult phases were equally important (see Fig. \ref{COMPADRE} in Supplementary Materials). Our analysis thus captures an important part of a tree's life cycles. However, we can not rule out the possibility that the regeneration phase has a disproportional importance for the dynamics at the edge, as several studies have shown that this phase is extremely sensitive to climate [@Clark-2014; @Defossez-2016; @Canham-2016]. Integrating regeneration in IPMs is challenging because we have much less data on this stage [@Needham-2018]. 

It is also important to keep in mind that species ranges are not necessarily related to the mean population growth rate but could be related to its temporal variability or the population resilience because they control extinction risk [@Holt-2005b]. Another explanation is that suitable habitats where population growth rates are unaffected might exist up to the edge due to the presence of suitable microsites [@Cavin-2017]. In this case, the species ranges arise because the fraction of suitable habitats available to the metapopulation decrease [@Holt-2000]. Finally, tree species distributions might not be in equilibrium with the current climate. This could be because species are either still in the process of recolonising from their ice age refugia [@Svenning-2004] or already affected by climate change. Such disequilibrium should however be visible by better performance at the cold edge [@Talluto-2017] and we found no evidence of this in our results. 

## **Synthesis** 

Our field study shows that trees' demographic responses at range edges are more complex than predicted by the ACH. Here, the patterns of demographic response of the 27 European tree species varied between their hot and cold edges. We only found strong evidence of demographic limits for edges occurring in extreme conditions (hot edges of hot-distributed species and cold edges of cold-distributed species). Our findings open an important perspective, as they show that one should not expect the same demographic response at the hot *vs.* the cold edge and that we need to refine predictions of climate change impacts in function of the species and edge characteristics.
